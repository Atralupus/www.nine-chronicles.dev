# Getting Started 

We're going to create a new blockchain network for Nine Chronicles to run on, one that doesn't participate in an existing network like the mainnet, but instead runs on its own on a local network.
By following this guide, you'll learn how to create a new private key, create a customized genesis block, run a blockchain node using this private key and genesis block, and watch a log of the blocks as they are created.

## Install .NET SDK 6

First, you need to install .NET SDK 6. The .NET SDK is available for various operating systems. Use the link below to download and install the appropriate installation file for your operating system:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0

After the installation is complete, open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command to verify that the installation was successful:
```shell
dotnet --version
```

If the installation has been completed successfully, the version number of the installed .NET SDK will be displayed. For example, a version number like "6.0.100" will appear.

Now that .NET SDK 6 is successfully installed, let's move on to the next step.
