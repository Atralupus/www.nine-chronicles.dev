# What is NineChronicles?

[Nine Chronicles][nc] is a decentralized game that runs on a full blockchain. We developed the game's protocol [Lib9c][lib9c] using the blockchain library [Libplanet][libplanet] and developed a blockchain node [NineChronicles.Headless][nc-headless] that uses it.
In addition, we are providing a [game client][nc-unity] developed using [Unity][unity] for attractive gameplay, and a [launcher][nc-launcher] that is responsible for patching and running the client and helping to connect to the blockchain network.
