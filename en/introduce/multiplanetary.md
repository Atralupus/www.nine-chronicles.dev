# Multiplanetary

Just as there are multiple servers in a centralized online game, the NineChronicles blockchain network also has multiple planets. In NineChronicles, this is referred to as Multiplanetary. Each planet within the Multiplanetary has information such as ID, name, and network access URL. Each planet operates independently, yet they are interconnected within the broader NineChronicles ecosystem.

## Planet Registry

The Multiplanetary information for each blockchain network can be found at the following URLs:
- mainnet: https://planets.nine-chronicles.com/planets/
- internal: https://planets-internal.nine-chronicles.com/planets/
