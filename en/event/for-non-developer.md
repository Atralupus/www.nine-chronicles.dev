# Welcome Non-Developers to the 2024 Modathon! ðŸŽ‰

Hello and welcome to all non-developers who are interested in participating in the Nine Chronicles Modathon! Don't worry if you're new to codingâ€”by following this guide, you'll be able to create a simple website that displays Nine Chronicles avatar information. ðŸŒŸ

Once you've followed through to the end, if you feel inspired, we encourage you to join the Modathon and submit your project. And if you have a cool mod idea but think it's too challenging, head over to the **#mod-ideas** channel in our Discord to find developers who can help bring your vision to life!

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

First things firstâ€”letâ€™s get you signed up on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a platform where developers store and collaborate on projects. Itâ€™s essential for submitting your mod in the Modathon.

1. Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and click **Sign Up**.
2. Follow the instructions to create your accountâ€”easy as that!

Once youâ€™ve signed up, youâ€™re ready to get started on your first project.

## Step 2: Modding Setup and Goal

Now letâ€™s explain our goal. You'll be setting up your environment to create a website that can display avatar information from Nine Chronicles. Weâ€™ll walk you through the basics, and you can follow the [Avatar Information Dapp Guide](https://modding/guide/avatar-information-dapp-guide) later to build the website step-by-step.

By the end of this guide, you'll have everything set up and ready to dive into that guide!

## Step 3: A Simple Introduction to JavaScript and TypeScript

Now, let's talk about two important technologies we'll be using: **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.

- **JavaScript (JS)** is one of the most popular programming languages for building websites. You can learn more about JS [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
- **TypeScript (TS)** is a language that builds on JavaScript, adding extra features to make development easier. Weâ€™ll be using TS because it makes our code more reliable. You can learn more about TS [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Donâ€™t worry! Weâ€™ll keep it simple, and by the end, youâ€™ll have your website up and running using TypeScript. 

### Installing Node and npm

To run our TypeScript code, we need to install **Node.js** and its package manager, **npm**. These are tools that help us manage all the code libraries needed to build websites.

Follow the appropriate link below based on your operating system:

- [Install Node.js on Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Install Node.js on macOS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Install Node.js on Linux](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Once Node.js and npm are installed, youâ€™ll be ready for the next step!

## Step 4: Installing a Code Editor (VS Code)

Now we need a text editor to write code. We'll be using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** because it's free and super easy to use!

1. Download and install VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Once installed, open it up and letâ€™s get started!

## Step 5: Create and Open a New Folder

In VS Code, weâ€™ll create a new folder for our project and open it to start working.

1. Create a new folder on your computer for the project.
2. Open VS Code and follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started#_step-1-open-a-folder-in-vs-code) to open that folder.

Great! Youâ€™re now ready to start coding!

## Step 6: Verify npm is Working

Now, letâ€™s verify that **npm** (the tool we installed earlier) is working properly. In VS Code, open the terminal by clicking on **Terminal > New Terminal**.
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/getting-started

In the terminal, type:

```bash
npm --version
```

If you see a version number, then everything is set up correctly!

## Step 7: Creating Your Website

Weâ€™re going to use a popular tool called **React** to build our website. React is a library that makes creating dynamic websites easier.

In your terminal, run the following command to create a project:

```bash
npx create-react-app your-project-name --template @planetarium/9c-mimir-gql
```

Replace `your-project-name` with whatever you want to name your project! This will download a template for your avatar information website.

Once itâ€™s done, navigate into your projectâ€™s folder by typing:

```bash
cd your-project-name
```

Now, run these commands to generate some code and start the project:

```bash
npm run codegen
npm run start
```

This will open a new tab in your browser where you can see the website running! ðŸŽ‰

## Step 8: How Did This Happen?

Letâ€™s quickly explain what just happened:

- **Node and npm**: These tools helped us install the libraries we need to build the website.
- **React**: We used React to create the website structure.
- **Code generation**: The `codegen` command fetched data from Nine Chronicles that we used in the website.

Now that everything is set up, you can follow the [Avatar Information Dapp Guide](https://modding/guide/avatar-information-dapp-guide) to finish building your website.

Even a simple website displaying avatar information is enough to submit for the Modathon! Of course, try to make it your ownâ€”don't just submit an exact copy of the tutorial. ðŸ˜Š

## Step 9: Donâ€™t Be Intimidated by Technical Terms!

You might see some technical terms like **GQL** in the guide. Donâ€™t worry about it! Just follow along step by step, and youâ€™ll get the website up and running. After you've completed the guide, take a moment to explore what you've created and understand how it works.

## Step 10: Join the Modathon!

If youâ€™ve made it this far, congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You now have a website that displays avatar information. If you're feeling inspired, go ahead and join the Modathon! Itâ€™s okay if itâ€™s a simple projectâ€”everyone starts somewhere.

Remember, even if you have a great idea but are unsure how to implement it, the **#mod-ideas** channel is there for you. Connect with developers who can help bring your idea to life!

Good luck, and have fun!
