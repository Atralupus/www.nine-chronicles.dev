# **Modathon Overview**

[Nine Chronicles](https://docs.nine-chronicles.com/introduction) is a decentralized idle RPG built on blockchain technology.
Over time, the community has created many exciting mods, and now, we want to see even more contributions. To support this, we're launching the **Nine Chronicles Modathon** with a prize pool of **225,000 NCG**.

We‚Äôve developed new tools to make modding easier, and even non-developers can participate with our beginner-friendly tutorials. Join us in shaping the future of Nine Chronicles and bring your ideas to life!

## **Purpose of the Modathon**

The primary goal of the Nine Chronicles Modathon is to strengthen the Nine Chronicles modding ecosystem and grow the number of community developers. We hope that the projects created during the modathon will continue to evolve and be used long after the event ends.  
Additionally, since all Nine Chronicles-related products are open-source, we encourage participants to contribute to them, fostering a collaborative and ongoing development process.

## **Modathon Detail**

The Nine Chronicles Modathon will primarily take place on the **[Planetarium Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/48JsEAAvMf)** server.
However, participants will have `#introduce-mods` on the main Planetarium Discord server to promote their mods, and you can also list your mod in the GitHub repository at [awesome-9c](https://github.com/planetarium/awesome-9c).

For event-related questions, a Q&A channel will be available `#2024modathon` on the **Planetarium Dev** server, and feedback on mods can be shared through the `#introduce-mods` channel. You‚Äôre also welcome to use your own Discord or website if you prefer.

We‚Äôre creating guides to make it easy for non-developers to join the modathon, so even if you‚Äôre new to development, we encourage you to give it a try.
If you have a mod idea, feel free to post it in the `#mod-ideas` channel on the **Planetarium Dev or Planetarium** server, where you can also find developers to collaborate with.

Seven days before the event concludes, we‚Äôll hold a community vote that will serve as a reference for the judging process.

## **Submission Guidelines**

To participate, submit your mod through [this Google form](https://forms.gle/UPXTRkk77QjKkzLc9), including the URL to your GitHub repository. The idea for your mod must be clearly described in the `README.md` of the repository.

While you can work in a team, the rewards‚Äîincluding participation rewards‚Äîwill be given to the individual who submits the project. If there are duplicate mods or suspected abuse, our team will review them and may reject the submissions. Also, you can submit multiple projects, but you can only win a prize for one.

If working as a team, any distribution of rewards is an internal matter to be settled between team members.

- Projects created before September 2024 are not eligible unless they include significant new features added after this date.
- Teams may work on one project together, but only the individual who submits the project will receive the rewards.
- All submissions must be open-source and use an appropriate license, such as GPL or AGPL.
- Registrations can be submitted at any time until the end of the competition, but we encourage early registration before October 1 to help ensure a smooth event process.
