# Getting Started 

We're going to create a new blockchain network for Nine Chronicles to run on, one that doesn't participate in an existing network like the mainnet, but instead runs on its own on a local network.
By following this guide, you'll learn how to create a new private key, create a customized genesis block, run a blockchain node using this private key and genesis block, and watch a log of the blocks as they are created.
